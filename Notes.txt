A Basic Chat Application made with Django Channels

- "channels" use ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and allow duplex
	(bidirectional) commuincation (like cell phones) as compared to http which is unidirectional.

- Web Socket:
	- A Client server communication Protocol just like HTTP
	- bidirectional, full duplex protocol
	- Stateful Protocol: connection between client and server remains alive
		untill terminated by either
	- start with 'wss://' or 'ws://' just like 'http://' or 'https://'

- Synchronous Communication: 
	A commuincation between client and server in which once the requests have been answered by the server, no further communication takes place until the user's next input.

- Asynchronous Communication:
	Multiple asynchronous communications between client and server may occur simultaneously or in parallel with one another

- async_to_sync():
	Takes an async function and returns a sync function that wraps it.

- sync_to_async():
	Takes a sync function and returns an async function that wraps it.
